\chapter{Introduction}
\emph{This thesis explores how global IPv6 addressing increases the attack surface of the Internet of Things (IoT) environment. The study combines not only a comprehensive literature review but also an empirical assessment of default system configurations through controlled laboratory demonstrations, highlighting how the adoption of new network standards can potentially affect the security of millions of end devices.}
